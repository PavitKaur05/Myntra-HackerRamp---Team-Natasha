## Project Description ##
Some of the common problems which customers face in online shopping are:
* While doing online shopping people do not get a fair idea of the look of the cloth. It is difficult to be sure that whether the color goes well with person’s complexion or whether the fit is appropriate with context of person’s body. 
* While buying makeup online it is very difficult to check whether it goes well with the person’s complexion, face shape and features.
So, have created a virtual try-on option application where the customer can try clothes
virtually and get a fair idea of the product.
